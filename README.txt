i wanna be the engine: scratalie edition
    an actually good scratch fangame engine
===========================================

about
-----
i wanna be the engine: scratalie edition (will be called "scratalie"
for the rest of this readme file) is a scratch fangame engine with a
goal on being as accurate as possible. as a result, ive had to create
my own custom collision system from the ground up, and its a bit of a
nightmare to understand first coming in. hopefully ill update this
file to make it less of a nightmare, but for now youll have to
analyze my code yourself. sorry.

history
-------
a few months ago i had an idea. a really funny idea. what if i were
to recreate the entirety of i wanna fly the far away in scratch?
being the person i am, i began to hack away at this, but then i
encountered a nasty bug, and decided to take a long break. now come
yesterday, and i suddenly wanted to give this idea another shot. i
then proceeded to finish it in about 1 day. i later discovered how
scratch, at a fundamental level, is incompatible with ftfa-like
needle gameplay, but i think i still succeeded at porting over
standard fangame physics to scratch. enjoy!

thanks
